I have used a Amazon Fine Food Reviews data, As the dataset size is too large(106 MB)
I am including the zip format of the data

You can unzip by running the below script

./setup.sh

If due to some unexpected reason, if the data is missing, you can download it using the below script

./download.sh

Some scripts are taking so long time to completly execute, so I have given output files

As the pos_tagging takes more time for entire corpus, I have ran it on first 2000 rows.
